# Car2Job

Car2Job is a web application for carpooling, useful for connect drivers and passengers and going to the job sharing the cost of the travel.

## Features 

First at all, you'll need to be logged in, then you'll find two different roles: Passenger and Driver.

### As passenger:
- You can create a route between point A (E.g. Your home) to point B (The place you work in). You'll find two Autocomplete inputs to ease your search!
- You can admit the driver that accepted your route. After that, the price of the route will be discounted of your pocket.
- You can rate the driver after the route.

### As a driver:
- You can accept different routes from different users/possible future passengers.
- When your offer is accepted by the user, your pocket will be increased with the route's price.
